nevermind people are indeed asking for this

(NEW) Yaml Options:
- Song Shop: Adds Song Shop items and Locations to the pool
- Soundscan Maps: Adds all Soundscan maps to the pool with the exceptions of Sunrise Showdown(goal requirement) and Encore Ensemble(didn't want to do it)
- long map: adds the long soundscan map that isn't worth it.

Goals:
- acta est fabula, plaudite
- Encore Episode

## How to use

### Warning: It is Strongly Advised that you beat this game normally first before using this manual.

What you'll need:
- [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/)(it's free!)
- the apworld
- a new save file(You can reset story progress from the options menu, the game automatically makes backups of your saves but I reccommend making another just in case)

### APWorld Setup

If you know how to generally use custom apworlds or manuals, you can skip this step. If you don't here's a quick rundown how to do that

- Download the apworld
- Double-click it to autoinstall it to your Archipelago installation. You can also install it manually by placing it in the `custom_worlds` folder
- Open the Launcher. and select "Generate Template Options". This will generate your YAML template. Adjust this to your liking
- Generate your game locally and upload it to the site to host the server(you do not need to do this if you're not hosting)
- Connect to the server with the Manual Client, and start playing!

### Game Setup

This manual makes liberal use of two(or three) accessibility options that can be enabled from the Options Menu.
- **Unlock All Songs:** This allows you to clear songs that you have on the client, but not in the Node Flowchart.
- **Unlock Conditions(Bypass):** This allows you to skip requirements for Story Locks and Gem Doors(Logically Story Locks only require a certain amount of that Chapter's songs).
- **Unlock All Modes:** Bypasses the Shop and Soundscan Locks. Mostly useful if you turn the Shop or Soundscan on

There are also other settings you can adjust to your liking in this menu
- **Currency Multiplier:** Reduces grinding for Points and Battery.
- **Flowchart Unlocks(Story):** Allows you to skip using Batteries for Story nodes.
- **Assist Mode:** Removes Challenge Gauges from Boss Songs.
- **Autoplay:** The game plays itself. Not really recommend for anything other than Soundscan gates you can't bypass manually.

- [hack's Betweenspace Maps](https://hack-3r64.github.io/betweenspace/) to make finding gems and Songs easier.(Currently outdated, the hidden areas in Layer 1 are in a seperate hub area now and some songs got swapped out. Everything else location-wise)
