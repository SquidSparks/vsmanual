###### nobody asked for this.

After a whole month of work ~and having to redo half of it because of the offical release~, you can play vivid/stasis in your multiworld. I don't know why you would, but you can!\
Currently updated to 5.0(Excluding the new songs in the shop because I was focused on making the story functional)

## Things in this rando:
- Items: Songs, Landing Keys, Tamasatchi Egg, Void Lens, Batteries(Filler), Gems(Filler)
- Locations : Node Flowchart, Song Clears, Betweenspace(Songs, Gems, Landing Keys, Egg, Void Lens), Soundscan(Only Sunrise Showdown currently), Unity Nexus Terminals

Goals:
- acta est fabula, plaudite
- Encore Episode

## How to use

### Warning: It is Strongly Advised that you beat this game normally first before using this manual.

What you'll need:
- [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/)(it's free!)
- a new save file(You can reset story progress from the options menu, the game automatically makes backups of your saves but I reccommend making another just in case)

This manual makes liberal use of two accessibility options that can be enabled from the Options Menu.
- **Unlock All Songs:** This allows you to clear songs that you have on the client, but not in the Node Flowchart.
- **Unlock Conditions(Bypass):** This allows you to skip requirements for Story Locks and Gem Doors(Logically Story Locks only require a certain amount of that Chapter's songs).

There are also other settings you can adjust to your liking in this menu
- **Currency Multiplier:** Reduces grinding for Points and Battery.
- **Flowchart Unlocks(Story):** Allows you to skip using Batteries for Story nodes.
- **Assist Mode:** Removes Challenge Gauges from Boss Songs.

Other helpful resources for this manual
- The [shrinereport Hints Hub](https://shrinereport.xyz/hints/hub.html) for puzzle solutions.(Enabling hints lets you press shift to automatically open the page on story locks)
- [hack's Betweenspace Maps](https://hack-3r64.github.io/betweenspace/) to make finding gems and Songs easier.(Currently outdated, the hidden areas in Layer 1 are in a seperate hub area now and some songs got swapped out. Everything else location-wise)
