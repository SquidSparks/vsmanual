## How to use

### Warning: It is Strongly Advised that you beat this game normally first before using this manual.
I can't stop you if you don't, but you are ruining it for yourself.


What you'll need:
- [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/)(it's free!)
- the apworld
- a new save file(Dependent on your options.)

This manual makes liberal use of two accessibility options that can be enabled from the Options Menu.
- **Unlock All Songs:** This allows you to clear songs that you have on the client, but not in the game
- **Unlock Conditions(Bypass):** This allows you to skip requirements for Story Locks and Gem Doors.

There are also other settings you can adjust to your liking in this menu
- **Currency Multiplier:** Reduces grinding for Points and Battery.
- **Flowchart Unlocks(Story):** Allows you to use less Batteries for story progression
- **Assist Mode:** Removes Challenge Gauges from Boss Songs.(Do not use if you have Deathlink on)
- **Autoplay:** The game plays itself. Not really recommended unless you really need to bypass a Soundscan Gate

Other helpful resources for this manual
- The [shrinereport Hints Hub](https://shrinereport.xyz/hints/hub.html) for puzzle solutions.(Enabling hints lets you press shift to automatically open the page on story locks)
- [hack's Betweenspace Maps](https://hack-3r64.github.io/betweenspace/) to make finding gems and Songs easier.(Slightly outdated)
- [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases/tag/Tracker_v0.2.11) because this game has a Lot of checks if you enable everything(Currently bugged with the Song Shop option, trying to investigate)
